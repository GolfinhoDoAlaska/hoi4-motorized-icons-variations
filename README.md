# hoi4-motorized-icons-variations
Basically this is a picture library of hoi4 motorized units' icons.

It's organized by the filter putted in the icons, like red icons are the default icons with a red color.

You can use it anywhere in your projects if you want (would be cool if you putted the credits but you are allowed to not putting it if you don't want to).
